# MyLog-M
Logging-As-A-Database-Service

This logging service was a carve-out project of MPASS.

## Example: Keyword search of log. ##
By logging into a database through the logging service, user can quickly filter by keywords to narrow down production issues.
Analytics and Alarms can also be added easily to the service - thus becoming a mini-Splunk.
